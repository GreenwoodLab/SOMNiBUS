\title{A smoothed-EM algorithm to estimate covariate effects and test regional association in Bisulfite Sequencing-derived methylation data}
\usage{
pred_BSMethEM(BEM.obj, newdata = NULL, type = "proportion")
}
\arguments{
\item{BEM.obj}{an output from the function \code{BSMethEM}}

\item{newdata}{the data set whose predictions are calculated}

\item{type}{return the predicted methylation proportion or the predicted response (in logit or other binom.link scale)}
}
\value{
This function returns the predicted methylation levels
}
\description{
This function fits a binomial regression model where the outcome - methylated reads- are contaminated by known error rates \code{p0} and \code{p1} and the covariate effects are smoothly varying across genomic positions. The functional parameters of the smooth covariate effects are first represented by a linear combination of a bunch of restricted cubic splines (with dimention \code{n.k}), and a smoothness penalization term which depends on the smoothing parameters \code{lambdas} is also added to control smoothness.

The estimation is performed by an iterated EM algorithm. Each M step constitutes an outer Newton's iteration to estimate smoothing parameters \code{lambdas} and an inner P-IRLS iteration to estimate spline coefficients \code{alpha} for the covariate effects. Currently, the computation in the M step depends the implementation of \code{gam()} in package \code{mgcv}.
